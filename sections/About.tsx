    // I'm a passionate software developer with a knack for building impactful digital experiences and solving real-world problems. With over 2 years of coding experience, I've honed my skills in technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js, along with a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms.

    // Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve created several full-stack projects, developed small-scale applications, and even contributed to open-source projects. Each project has strengthened my problem-solving mindset and deepened my curiosity for understanding how technology works.

    // Outside of coding, I'm interested in exploring AI, contributing to open-source communities, and connecting with other developers to learn and grow. Iâ€™m constantly excited to take on new challenges and further develop my technical skills. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out!`;
